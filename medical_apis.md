## openFDA APIs

### Drug Adverse Event API
- **Purpose:** Provides data on adverse events and medication error reports submitted to FDA (from FAERS database).
- **Data Source:** FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).
- **Time Period:** 2004 to present.
- **Update Frequency:** Quarterly (data may lag by 3 months or more).
- **Relevance:** Useful for understanding potential side effects and safety profiles of drugs. However, it's important to note that a causal relationship between product and reactions cannot be established solely from this data, as reports are voluntary and not extensively validated.

### Drug Product Labeling API
- **Purpose:** Returns data from Structured Product Labeling (SPL) submissions by drug manufacturers and distributors.
- **Data Source:** Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format.
- **Time Period:** Primarily from June 2009 to present.
- **Update Frequency:** Weekly.
- **Relevance:** Provides detailed information about drug products, including indications for use, adverse reactions, and other labeling information. This can be a valuable source for drug descriptions and related medical information.




## HealthIT.gov Open Data API
- **Purpose:** Provides access to open datasets available through Health IT Data.
- **Data Source:** Various datasets from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).
- **Relevance:** This API could be a valuable source of structured medical data, depending on the specific datasets available. It's necessary to explore the list of accessible datasets to determine their relevance to the user's project. The documentation provides clear instructions on how to query the API and filter the data, which is a positive.
